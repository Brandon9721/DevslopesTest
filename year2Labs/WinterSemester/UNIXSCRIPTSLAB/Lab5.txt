1. Pipes a)
#!/bin/bash
ls | wc -l

b)
#!/bin/bash
ls | LOGNAME | sort -n


2. Redirection
a)
#!/bin/sh
cat < test.txt > ctest.txt

b)
#!/bin/sh
cat >> test.txt

c)
#!/bin/sh
cat < test.txt >> test.txt

infinte loop continuously doubles itself which would crash the program


3. Pipes and Redirection

ls | sort -r > test.txt
#sorts the entries in current directory in reverse, copys to text file


4. Pattern matching

a)
ls  /etc/??.*
# or ls /DIRECTORY NAME/??.*  <-- 2 char file names in directory with variable extension lengths

b) 
ls [a-z][a-z].*

c)
ls *.c

d)
ls p* | grep “t”

5. Shell Variables

a)
5
5
5
val


6.
a) zero
b) two
c) two


7. Conditional Execution

#!/bin/bash
gcc $1 && ./a.out


#This will take in terminal argument for a c filename.c and compile it, then run it
#Not sure what car (car filename) was for so just named the script car.sh

#run this scrip as "./car.sh file.c”  
# the file.c has to be a .c file in current directory



8. Metacharacters

echo Captain, where is the'$978' screwdriver?


9. Control Structures

#!/bin/sh

for i in U N I X

do
echo give me a $i
echo $i
done


10. Control Structures

#!/bin/bash

counter = 1
for i in $*

do
counter=$(( $counter + 1))
echo This is argument $counter : arg $i


done






11. Control Structures

#### SETUP FIRST 
# create text file in home directory
# create these 2 scripts and save them somewhere such as desktop
# open terminal and chmod 777 both files so they can execute and run
# then enter “./EXECUTEMAIL.sh testfile.c Brandon Steve Matt”
# “./EXECUTEMAIL.sh AnotherTest.c Ryan Travis Devin Kashif”

# after running executemail.sh with some command line arguments, go to the letlog.txt
# file in home directory, it should have logs of file being sent, who it got
# sent to and time stamp



#SAVE THIS FILE AS MAIL.sh
#!/bin/bash

counter=1    					
now=$(date +"%T")
echo MAILING FILE: $1
shift ## Shifts to the next argument
for i in $*

do
counter=$(( $counter + 1))

echo Sending file to: $i at date $now

done
