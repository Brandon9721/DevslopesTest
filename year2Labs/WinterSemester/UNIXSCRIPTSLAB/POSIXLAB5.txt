1. Pipes a)
#!/bin/bash
ls | wc -l

b)
#!/bin/bash
ls | LOGNAME | sort -n


2. Redirection
a)
#!/bin/sh
cat < test.txt > ctest.txt

b)
#!/bin/sh
cat >> test.txt

c)
#!/bin/sh
cat < test.txt >> test.txt

infinte loop continuously doubles itself which would crash the program


3. Pipes and Redirection

ls | sort -r > test.txt
#sorts the entries in current directory in reverse, copys to text file


4. Pattern matchin

a)
ls  /etc/??.*
# or ls /DIRECTORY NAME/??.*  <-- 2 char file names in directory with variable extension lengths
