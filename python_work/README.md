# Practicing Python  

Currently reading the **Python Crash Course** book by Eric Matthes.  
Only a short ways into the book so my examples folder only contains a few files.  

#### To execute python scripts:  
- A python compiler must be installed on the machine (built into most Unix distros and Mac OS X)  
- Then in the terminal, execute it using this syntax `python ./hello_world.py`  (python ./scriptName.py)   
or (python3 ./scriptName.py) if python3 is installed.
